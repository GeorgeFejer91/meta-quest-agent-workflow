# Playbook And Owner Index

Use this index to select the smallest relevant Meta Quest playbook and then
follow the linked application contract for executable behavior. Meta workflow
docs own portable procedure and evidence boundaries. They do not replace
application command, authorization, effective-state, receipt, or cleanup
authority.

Empirical Quest, Horizon OS, UI, and tool observations remain versioned
evidence. Recheck the current device/tool build before treating them as current.

| Task | Meta workflow playbook | Application or protocol owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolve repository playbooks from an installed router skill | [Local playbook resolution](local-playbook-resolution.md) | Installed provenance and the exact canonical Meta Quest workflow commit own the documentation identity; the locator grants no runtime authority |
| Routine build, deploy, launch, validate, and cleanup | [Default device loop](rusty-morphospace-default-device-loop.md) | [QFM inspected deployment](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/QuestIonAble-File-Manager/blob/main/docs/inspected-deployment.md), [Kiosk CLI](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/Rusty-Kiosk/blob/main/docs/CLI.md), [Fleet workflow](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/rusty-fleet/blob/main/docs/WORKFLOW.md) |
| Fast APK iteration, cache invalidation, candidate assembly, or build timing | [Quest APK build lanes](quest-apk-build-lanes.md) | The work environment owns composition and lane isolation; the app shell or Rusty Quest owns the Android build adapter and final APK inspection |

| Screenshots, recording, screenrecord, MediaProjection, UI capture, or Cinematic casting | [Capture stack notes](quest-capture-stack-notes.md) and [capture taxonomy](capture-source-taxonomy.md) | The selected Meta/platform tool, Android/ADB transport, MediaProjection application, Rusty Quest adapter, or Hostess route owns only its declared effect; see [Rusty Quest media runtime](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/rusty-quest/blob/main/docs/MEDIA_STREAM_RUNTIME.md) and [Rusty Hostess](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/rusty-hostess) (`docs/EVIDENCE_BUNDLE.md` and `docs/meta-quest-casting-adapter.md`) when those providers are selected |
| Quest/Quest or Quest/PC streaming and direct-link promotion | [Streaming and direct-link gates](quest-streaming-and-direct-link-gates.md) | [Manifold media authority](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/rusty-manifold/blob/main/docs/MEDIA_SESSION_AUTHORITY.md), [Rusty Quest remote streaming](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/rusty-quest/blob/main/docs/REMOTE_CAMERA_STREAMING.md), selected peer/host provider |
| Termux, X11, Proot, VNC, off-LAN control, or Wireless ADB | [Termux and Linux sidecars](termux-linux-sidecars.md) | The selected sidecar application owns its endpoint; no shell, HOME, app socket, or Manifold authority is implied |
| Managed Individual/Shared Mode or Store-installed applications | [Managed device and Store apps](managed-device-store-apps.md) | Meta managed-device/Store policy, the organization administrator, account entitlement, distribution route, and selected application retain their separate authority; [Fleet](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/rusty-fleet/blob/main/docs/WORKFLOW.md) owns only an explicitly selected orchestration operation |
| Meta VR CLI, Horizon MCP, `metavr`, or `hzdb` | [Meta Horizon MCP and hzdb](meta-horizon-mcp-and-hzdb.md) | Meta tooling is an optional evidence provider, not application authority |

| Long-run awake/proximity stability and watchdog cleanup | [Long-running watchdogs](long-running-watchdogs.md) | [QFM awake control](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/QuestIonAble-File-Manager/blob/main/docs/quest-awake-control.md) or [Fleet awake control](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/rusty-fleet/blob/main/docs/QUEST_AWAKE_CONTROL.md) when selected |

| Failure triage | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) | Follow the symptom to the focused playbook and selected owner; do not substitute a generic command |

## Distribution Rule

Global skills route across owners. Application `AGENTS.md`, help, schemas, and
generated agent bundles describe only that application's capabilities and
receipts. Project-local instructions own live project state. Private planning
and evidence own machine paths, identities, credentials, raw captures, and
unsanitized decisions.
