# Termux And Linux Sidecars

Termux can be useful on Quest as a visible developer lab sidecar. Treat it as
a normal Android app, not as Android `shell`, not as HOME, not as a kiosk
policy engine, not as an XR runtime authority, and not as a hidden watchdog.

## Good Uses

- CLI diagnostics and package experiments.
- Local static dashboards bound to device localhost.
- Headless localhost command/status services for foreground headset apps.
- Termux:X11 foreground panels for small X11 clients.
- Proot CLI tools and small GUI client experiments.
- Host-visible evidence capture and direct stream-frame pulls through explicit
  ADB forwarding.

## Boundaries

- Termux does not gain `shell` identity by being installed on the headset.
- Android `am`, `pm`, and `cmd` behavior from the Termux app UID can be useful
  for queries while still being blocked for privileged or cross-package actions.
- ADB from inside Termux still depends on normal user authorization and should
  be treated as externally leased developer access.
- If an operator deliberately enables the classic TCP ADB lab route on
  `127.0.0.1:5555`, keep it distinct from modern TLS Wireless Debugging and
  require `adb shell id` to report `uid=2000(shell)` before install, launch,
  logcat, wake, or package-management commands.
- Termux ADB subprocesses need a writable temporary directory. Use `TMPDIR`
  when already set, or create `$PREFIX/tmp` before starting ADB.
- APKs for Termux-mediated installs should live in a path the Termux process
  can read. Prefer Termux-private storage or an explicitly staged readable
  path; do not assume public shared storage is readable from every
  non-interactive Termux execution context.
- Termux:Boot, wake locks, full desktop environments, audio servers, remote
  shell services, graphics acceleration, and LAN-visible VNC all require
  separate gates.

## OpenXR API Layer Client Boundary

Termux may act as a client of a custom OpenXR API layer only when the target XR
APK already packages and activates that layer and exposes a bounded,
authenticated adapter. A safe shape is:

```text
Termux typed client
  -> authenticated localhost or Binder adapter
  -> accepted low-rate action state
  -> API layer already loaded in the foreground app
  -> app-visible OpenXR readback
```

Termux cannot attach a layer after the target created its OpenXR instance,
install a system layer with ordinary app privileges, or inject one into an
arbitrary Store app. Do not expose raw OpenXR function names, handles, generic
controller injection, or high-rate poses through a sidecar. Keep command
admission with the owning app or Manifold and require an explicit synthetic-
input release and cleanup receipt.

Use [OpenXR SDK, API Layer, And Tracking Boundary](openxr-tracking-boundary.md)
for the capability and Android packaging model.

## Classic TCP Loopback ADB Install/Update

Only after an operator or external workflow explicitly enables the classic
TCP ADB listener on port `5555`, Termux can run:

```sh
export TMPDIR="${TMPDIR:-$PREFIX/tmp}"
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"
adb connect 127.0.0.1:5555
adb -s 127.0.0.1:5555 shell id
```

The pass condition is Android shell UID:

```text
uid=2000(shell)
```

When that gate passes, Termux may use the leased ADB shell for bounded
developer operations such as `adb install -r`, allowlisted `am start`, focused
`dumpsys`, or bounded logcat. This can avoid Android's normal installer
confirmation because the install authority is ADB shell, not the Termux app
UID. It still does not prove reboot durability, device-owner management, MDM,
or app-side silent updates.

Keep artifact staging explicit. A Termux-owned updater should download into a
Termux workspace or another readable path. A host-staged `/data/local/tmp` APK
is acceptable lab plumbing when recorded as external ADB workflow state, but it
should not become the default app communication or update channel.

## Modern TLS Wireless Debugging Topology Gate

Do not infer Wireless ADB availability from the presence of a local interface
or an Android NSD callback. A live Quest probe tested two headset-owned
topologies after disconnecting the ordinary infrastructure Wi-Fi association:

- peerless Wi-Fi Direct with the Quest as group owner; and
- Android `LocalOnlyHotspot` with the Quest as hotspot owner.

Both topologies retained a local interface, proving that the headset can host
local networking without a router. Neither topology started modern TLS
Wireless Debugging on the tested Horizon OS build:

- `adb_wifi_enabled` remained or returned to `0`;
- `service.adb.tls.port` was empty;
- no protected Meta approval Activity appeared; and
- Termux could not prove `uid=2000(shell)`.

Android NSD also returned a cached `_adb-tls-connect._tcp` endpoint from the
previous infrastructure-network epoch. Treat discovery as advisory. Recovery
passes only when the setting is currently enabled, a current TLS listener is
reachable, and an independent `adb shell id` reports `uid=2000(shell)`.
Modern Wireless Debugging uses the current dynamically assigned TLS connect
port; never silently substitute the classic port `5555` when current listener
proof is absent.

For a separately authorized and paired Termux ADB client, use that observed
port explicitly:

```sh
adb connect 127.0.0.1:<current-tls-connect-port>
adb -s 127.0.0.1:<current-tls-connect-port> shell id
```

Do not reuse the classic TCP commands above for this modern TLS route.

The validated modern TLS route therefore still requires an infrastructure
Wi-Fi access point. The provider can be a router, phone hotspot, PC hotspot, or
travel router; it does not need internet service or a connected PC once the
one-time installation, grants, authorization, and pairing are complete.

This is consistent with Android's documented requirement that the device and
workstation use the same wireless network for normal Wireless Debugging and
with AOSP's ADB manager consulting the active Wi-Fi connection during
enablement. Horizon OS's protected confirmation Activity is a separate
platform surface:

- <https://developer.android.com/tools/adb#connect-to-a-device-over-wi-fi>
- <https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/f2387994151f/services/core/java/com/android/server/adb/AdbDebuggingManager.java>

When the headset has internet but is not on the same WiFi as the operator
machine, trigger updates through outbound control. The operator or CI publishes
a verified APK manifest to an HTTPS controller; the Termux agent polls outbound,
downloads the APK, checks the loopback ADB shell gate, and installs locally.
Do not require inbound ADB, a public headset listener, or shared LAN reachability
for the normal trigger path. Use direct external ADB only for local setup and
recovery.

## Saved-source Wi-Fi control boundary

An active Wi-Fi ADB transport and `uid=2000(shell)` can support serial-scoped
observation and a supervised helper, but they do not by themselves prove that a
saved-source transition works. A guarded consumer-device probe stopped while
reflecting a supposed selection-reason field named
`NETWORK_SELECTION_ENABLE`. Source review corrected that diagnosis: in AOSP
Android 14, `NETWORK_SELECTION_ENABLED` is the enabled-status field,
`DISABLED_NONE` is the no-disable-reason field, and
`NETWORK_SELECTION_ENABLE` is a diagnostic/persisted label rather than a field.
The stopped probe therefore did not establish a privilege limitation or an
absent target member. A later read-only probe on an API 34 Quest build resolved
`NETWORK_SELECTION_ENABLED` and `DISABLED_NONE` to `0`, resolved the disable-
reason accessor, and confirmed that reflecting `NETWORK_SELECTION_ENABLE`
throws `NoSuchFieldException`; connectivity remained unchanged. This verifies
the target API names, not saved-source switching. Transition behavior still
requires effective-state readback.

Treat a saved-source transition as admissible only when each target-build
member used by its exact baseline predicate is present and the final readback
still matches. Distinguish a wrong reflective name from a field that is truly
unavailable. Do not substitute a guessed numeric constant, accept a partial
predicate, or treat BLE as evidence that the transition works. Use an attended,
user-visible, or separately authorized management route when that proof is
unavailable.

## Outbound Remote Operations

Use `quest-termux-lab` for public-safe remote-operations schemas, the
controller simulator, the Termux fleet agent, and synthetic fixtures. The safe
shape is:

```text
operator web console
  -> authenticated controller with typed command queue
  -> command with TTL, idempotency key, operator reason, and lease id
Quest Termux agent
  -> outbound poll, long poll, or WebSocket
  -> active remote-session lease and local allowlist checks
  -> optional loopback ADB shell gate
  -> bounded result plus redacted evidence
```

The browser UI should never become a raw device proxy. Do not expose ADB,
Termux listeners, VNC, or headset-local HTTP services to the internet. Do not
tunnel the Quest ADB port. Do not add raw shell, raw input, or terminal-text
commands. Prefer purpose-specific command kinds such as verified update,
allowlisted launch, foreground snapshot, bounded logcat, UIAutomator scenario,
MediaProjection preview request/stop, helper restart status, and ADB lease
check/disconnect.

Any command beyond passive `agent.status` and `agent.capabilities` should be
under a human-visible remote-session lease. Record lease id, operator, purpose,
expiry, scopes, consent mode, visual-confirmation requirement, local ADB shell
requirement, active-session indicator, and emergency-stop/revocation behavior.
This lease is separate from the loopback ADB shell lease: a command can have
operator consent and still fail because `adb shell id` does not report
`uid=2000(shell)`.

For UIAutomator-backed Quest Settings or recorder mapping, bridge through a
command like `uiautomator.run_allowlisted_scenario`, not through a free-form
ADB command. `quest-termux-lab` now implements this as a named-scenario bridge:
it checks the remote-session lease, checks the loopback ADB shell gate,
accepts only configured scenarios and allowlisted extras, and defaults to a
redacted command summary. Keep raw XML, screenshots, recordings, logcat
bundles, device serials, local paths, installed app names, and private package
IDs in local evidence only.

The useful public scenario split is now:

- `settingsRecoveryProbe` for zero-node/invisible Quest Settings relaunch
  diagnostics without force-stop or package killing;
- `systemSurfaceReachability` for passive structural comparison of current
  window, quick settings, notifications, Android settings, and Metacam entry
  points;
- focused settings crawlers or child-page probes only after the corresponding
  surface is visible and the route is scoped.

For visual feedback, use two lanes. The low-risk witness lane is foreground
readback, focused-window lines, bounded UIAutomator summaries, and explicitly
allowed screenshots. The interactive lane is an app-owned MediaProjection flow
with user consent, a visible active-session indicator, and a transport such as
WebRTC or a simpler authenticated preview stream. MediaProjection can provide
immediate display-composite frames to an app or receiver, but it is not raw
camera access and does not bypass user consent. The Termux lab's
`media_projection.preview_request` and `media_projection.preview_stop` command
kinds should remain rejected placeholders until a separate app-owned helper
owns the Android/Meta consent token and visible active-session indicator.

## Visible Helper Restart

A normal Android helper can restart a stopped Termux fleet agent when all of
these conditions are true:

- the helper is installed and operator-visible;
- the helper has been granted `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND`;
- Termux is configured to allow external commands, for example
  `allow-external-apps=true`;
- the helper calls Termux's `RunCommandService` with `startForegroundService()`
  on Android 8+;
- the command is a fixed reviewed starter for the fleet agent, not a generic
  remote shell.

A live Quest run force-stopped `com.termux`, launched the helper Activity with
an auto-start extra, and observed Termux plus
`python termux_fleet_agent.py --config config.json` running again. The
controller received fresh heartbeats, and the latest heartbeat reported
`central_reachable=true`, `local_adb.available=true`, and
`local_adb.shell_uid=2000`.

Use this as operator-visible stopped-process recovery only. It does not restore
WiFi ADB after reboot, make Termux or the helper Android `shell`, bypass user
debugging authorization, or provide a managed-device update channel.

## Headless Sidecar Notes

For many XR workflows, a visible Linux desktop is unnecessary. A small
Termux-owned command/status service bound to device localhost can let a
foreground headset app request allowlisted Linux-side work and receive
structured results.

Initial Quest validation showed a Termux localhost JSON service can continue
answering status and command requests while another headset app is foregrounded
and no X11 desktop surface is visible.

Keep this route constrained:

- bind to localhost by default;
- use allowlisted commands and argument schemas;
- return structured stdout, stderr, exit code, timing, and status;
- include timeouts, cancellation, and audit/event records;
- add authentication or a local capability token before product use;
- treat long-running survival across sleep, reboot, and battery policy as a
  separate gate.

## Termux:X11 Notes

Start with the smallest visible X11 client before trying a full desktop. Record
the actual operator interaction needed to focus or move the pointer; on Quest,
panel focus can behave differently from a desktop mouse hover.

Basic terminal typing can work, but display geometry and text-heavy layouts
need their own validation. Do not promote a text editor or full desktop recipe
until the panel size, input focus, keyboard behavior, and cleanup path are
repeatable.

Native phone-like Termux:X11 geometry can present more reliably in the headset
2D panel than resized landscape roots. Exact landscape Termux:X11 display
preferences can fix X-root/VNC left-slice output, but the Termux Android
activity may still stay constrained or letterboxed. If a landscape X root is
visible through VNC but black, cropped, or incomplete in the headset panel,
classify that as an evidence route or geometry distinction, not automatically
as a Linux process failure.

Do not rely on shell-level Android task resize as a panel correction workflow.
It can mismatch task/root bounds and crop the desktop. For headset-visible
full-desktop observation, prefer a separate landscape viewer panel that
consumes a localhost-only VNC/MJPEG bridge. Initial validation shows this route
can present a full 1280x720 desktop stream in a Quest 2D panel.

## Proot Notes

Proot is useful for Linux userland packages, but GUI compatibility is
package-specific and performance can vary. Keep Proot as a lab affordance until
the exact package, display route, and cleanup behavior are known.

## VNC Notes

Use VNC only as a bounded visibility route:

```powershell
adb -s <serial> forward tcp:<host-port> tcp:<device-port>
```

Safe defaults:

- bind the VNC server to localhost when possible;
- use ADB forwarding for host access;
- capture the evidence needed, preferably from a direct frame/status endpoint;
- stop the VNC server;
- remove the ADB forward;
- verify that no listener remains.

If a VNC server fails on Android shared-memory permissions, retry with an
explicit no-shared-memory mode and record the exact flags. VNC mirrors the X
display; it does not fix headset-side panel geometry.

Keep these witnesses separate:

- X-root evidence: VNC screenshots, MJPEG `/frame.jpg`, or stream
  `/status.json`.
- Headset-panel evidence: ADB or headset-provider screenshots of the Quest
  display.
- Viewer-panel evidence: a separate landscape Android panel showing the
  localhost MJPEG bridge.
- Human-observer evidence: browser-window or cast-window captures.

## Session Recipe Shape

Reduce desktop or Linux sidecar ideas to data-first session recipes before
running large bootstrap scripts:

```text
preflight
start
status
stop
cleanup
evidence
risk
authority boundary
```

Do not copy source from third-party desktop setup projects unless licensing and
attribution have been reviewed. Prefer original small recipes and synthetic
fixtures.

## Evidence Checklist

For each sidecar test, record:

- device model and Android version;
- provider used: ADB, app status endpoint, headset operator, or MCP;
- exact package/source family for Termux components;
- foreground surface before and after;
- process and listener snapshots;
- whether any headset prompt was intentional;
- cleanup verification.
